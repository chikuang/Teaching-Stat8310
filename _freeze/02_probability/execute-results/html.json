That is, $\\neg F$ is the statement that $F$ is not true.\n\n-   Let $F \\vee G$ denote the disjunction (or) of statements $F$ and $G$, meaning that at least one of $F$ or $G$ is true.\n\n-   Let $F \\wedge G$ denote the conjunction (and) of statements $F$ and $G$, meaning that both $F$ and $G$ are true.\n\n::: {.callout-definition title = \"Axioms of Beliefs\"}\n\nIt has been argued by many that any function that is to numerically represent our beliefs should have the following properties:\n\n-   **B1**: $\\mathrm{Be}(\\neg H\\mid H) \\le \\mathrm{Be}(F \\mid H) \\le \\mathrm{Be}(H \\mid H)$\n\n-   **B2**: $\\mathrm{Be}(F \\vee G\\mid H) \\ge  \\max\\{\\mathrm{Be}(F \\mid H), \\mathrm{Be}(G\\mid H)\\}$\n\n-   **B3**: $\\mathrm{Be}(F \\wedge G\\mid H)$ can be derived from $\\mathrm{Be}(G\\mid H)$ and $\\mathrm{Be}(F\\mid G \\wedge H)$. \n\n:::\n\nHow should we interpret these properties, and do they make sense?\n\n-   B1 means that the number we assign to $\\mathrm{Be}(F \\mid H)$, our conditional belief in $F$ given $H$, is bounded below and above by the numbers we assign to complete disbelief $\\mathrm{Be}(\\neg H \\mid H)$ and complete belief $\\mathrm{Be}(H \\mid H)$.\n\n-   B2 says that our belief that the truth lies in a given set of possibilities should not decrease as we add to the set of possibilities.\n\n-   B3 is a bit trickier. To see why it makes sense, imagine you have to decide whether or not $F$ and $G$ are true, knowing that $H$ is true. You could do this by first deciding whether or not $G$ is true given $H$, and if so, then deciding whether or not $F$ is true given $G$ and $H$.\n\n::: {.callout-definition title = \"Axioms of Probability\"}\n\nRecall the notation from (elementary) probability that, $F\\cup G$ means F or G, and $F\\cap G$ means F and G, and $\\emptyset$ is the empty set.\n\n-   **P1**: $$\n    0=\\mathrm{Pr}(\\neg H \\mid H) \\leq \\mathrm{Pr}(F \\mid H) \\leq \\mathrm{Pr}(H \\mid H)=1\n    $$\n\n-   **P2**: $$\\mathrm{Pr}(F \\cup G \\mid H)=\\mathrm{Pr}(F \\mid H)+\\mathrm{Pr}(G \\mid H),\\quad \\text{if}\\quad F \\cap G=\\emptyset$$\n\n-   **P3**: $$\\mathrm{Pr}(F \\cap G \\mid H)=\\mathrm{Pr}(G \\mid H) \\mathrm{Pr}(F \\mid G \\cap H)$$\n\n:::\n\n### Conclusion\n\nYou can see that, a probability function satisfy P1--P3 also satisfies B1--B3.

Let {H1,H2,H3,H4} be the events that a randomly selected person in this sample is in, respectively, the lower 25th percentile, the second 25th percentile, the third 25th percentile and the upper 25th percentile in terms of income. By definition,\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(H_1\\right), \\operatorname{Pr}\\left(H_2\\right), \\operatorname{Pr}\\left(H_3\\right), \\operatorname{Pr}\\left(H_4\\right)\\right\\}=\\{.25, .25, .25, .25\\} .\n$$\n\nNote that $\\{H1,H2,H3,H4\\}$ is a partition and so these probabilities sum to 1. Let $E$ be the event that a randomly sampled person from the survey has a college education. From the survey data, we have $$\\{\\mathrm{Pr}(E\\mid H_1), \\mathrm{Pr}(E\\mid H_2),\\mathrm{Pr}(E\\mid H_3), \\mathrm{Pr}(E\\mid H_4)\\} = \\{.11, .19, .31, .53\\}.$$ These probabilities do not sum to 1 - they represent the proportions of people with college degrees in the four different income subpopulations $H_1, H_2, H_3$ and $H_4$. Now let’s consider the income distribution of the college-educated population. Using Bayes’ rule we can obtain\n\n$\\{\\mathrm{Pr}(H_1\\mid E), \\mathrm{Pr}(H_2\\mid E), \\mathrm{Pr}(H_3\\mid E), \\mathrm{Pr}(H_4 \\mid E)\\} = \\{0.09, 0.17, 0.27, 0.47\\} ,$ and we see that the income distribution for people in the college-educated population differs markedly from $\\{0.25, 0.25,0.25,0.25\\}$, the distribution for the general population. Note that these probabilities do sum to 1 - they are the conditional probabilities of the events in the partition, given $E$.\n:::\n\nIn Bayesian inference, ${H_1, . . . ,H_K}$ often refer to disjoint hypotheses or states of nature and $E$ refers to the outcome of a survey, study or experiment. To compare hypotheses *post-experimentally*, we often calculate the following ratio: $$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(H_i \\mid E\\right)}{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(H_j \\mid E\\right)} & =\\frac{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(E \\mid H_i\\right) \\operatorname{Pr}\\left(H_i\\right) / \\operatorname{Pr}(E)}{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(E \\mid H_j\\right) \\operatorname{Pr}\\left(H_j\\right) / \\operatorname{Pr}(E)} \\\\\n& =\\frac{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(E \\mid H_i\\right) \\operatorname{Pr}\\left(H_i\\right)}{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(E \\mid H_j\\right) \\operatorname{Pr}\\left(H_j\\right)} \\\\\n& =\\frac{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(E \\mid H_i\\right)}{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(E \\mid H_j\\right)} \\times \\frac{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(H_i\\right)}{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(H_j\\right)} \\\\\n& =\\text { \"Bayes factor\" × \"prior beliefs\". }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ This calculation reminds us that Bayes’ rule does not determine what our *beliefs should be* after seeing the data, it only tells us how they *should change after seeing the data*.\n\n## Independence\n\n::: {.callout-definition title=\"(Conditional) Independence\"}\nTwo events $F$ and $G$ are conditionally independent, if given $H$, we have $\\mathrm{Pr}(F \\cap G \\mid H) = \\mathrm{Pr}(F\\mid H)\\mathrm{Pr}(G\\mid H)$.\n:::\n\nHow do we interpret conditional independence? By Axiom P3, the following is always true: $$\n\\begin{array}{rlll}\n\\operatorname{Pr}(G \\mid H) \\operatorname{Pr}(F \\mid H \\cap G) \\stackrel{\\text { always }}{=} \\operatorname{Pr}(F \\cap G \\mid H) & \\stackrel{\\text { independence }}{=} \\operatorname{Pr}(F \\mid H) \\operatorname{Pr}(G \\mid H) \\\\\n\\operatorname{Pr}(G \\mid H) \\operatorname{Pr}(F \\mid H \\cap G) & = & \\operatorname{Pr}(F \\mid H) \\operatorname{Pr}(G \\mid H) \\\\\n\\operatorname{Pr}(F \\mid H \\cap G) & = & \\operatorname{Pr}(F \\mid H) .\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThus, conditional independence implies that $\\mathrm{Pr}(F \\mid H \\cap G) = \\mathrm{Pr}(F\\mid H)$. In other words, if we know $H$ is true, and $F$ and $G$ are conditionally independent given $H$, then knowing $G$ does not change our belief about $F$.\n\n\n::: {.callout-example title = \"Conditional independence\"}\n\nLet’s consider the conditional dependence of $F$ and $G$ when $H$ is assumed to be true in the following two situations:\n\nSiutation 1:\n\n-   F = { a hospital patient is a smoker }\n-   G = { a hospital patient has lung cancer }\n-   H = { smoking causes lung cancer}\n\nSituation 2:\n\n-   F = { a student studies regularly for an exam }\n-   G = { a student receives a high exam score }\n-   H = { studying improves exam performance }\n\nThink: In both of these situations, H being true implies a relationship between $F$ and $G$. What about when $H$ is not true? \n\n:::\n\n## Random Variables\n\n*In Bayesian inference a random variable is defined as an unknown numerical quantity about which we make probability statements.* For example, the quantitative outcome of a survey, experiment or study is a random variable before the study is performed. Additionally, a fixed but unknown population parameter is also a random variable\n\n### Discrete Ramdon variables\n\nLet $Y$ be a random variable and let $\\mathcal{Y}$ be the set of all possible values that $Y$ can take. If $\\mathcal{Y}$ is countable, meaning that $\\mathcal{Y} = \\{y_1,y_2,\\dots\\}$, then $Y$ is a discrete random variable.\n\n\n::: {.callout-definition title = \"Probability mass function\"}\n\nThe event that the outcome $Y$ of our survey has the value $Y$ is expressed as $\\{Y=y\\}$. For each $y\\in\\mathcal{Y}$, the shorthand notation for $\\mathrm{Pr}(Y=y)$ is $p(y)$, and $p(\\cdot)$ is called the **probability mass function** of $Y$, and with two properties\n\n1.  $0 \\leq p(y) \\leq 1$ for all $y\\in\\mathcal{Y}$,\n\n2.  $\\sum_{y\\in\\mathcal{Y}} p(y) = 1$. \n\n:::\n\nGeneral probability statements about $Y$ can be derived from the pdf/pmf, for example, for any subset $A \\subseteq \\mathcal{Y}$, we have $\\mathrm{Pr}(Y\\in A) = \\sum_{y\\in A} p(y)$. When we have two disjoint subsets $A$ and $B$ of $\\mathcal{Y}$, we have $$\\mathrm{Pr}(Y\\in A \\cup B) = \\mathrm{Pr}(Y\\in A) + \\mathrm{Pr}(Y\\in B)=\\sum_{y\\in A} p(y) + \\sum_{y\\in B} p(y).$$\n\n\n::: {.callout-example title = \"Binomial distribution\"}\n\nLet $Y$ be the number of successes in $n$ independent Bernoulli trials, each with probability of success $\\theta$. Then, $Y$ follows a Binomial distribution with parameters $n$ and $\\theta$, denoted as $Y \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(n,p)$. The probability mass function of $Y$ is given by $$\np(y) = \\mathrm{Pr}(Y=y) = \\binom{n}{y} \\theta^y (1-\\theta)^{n-y}, \\quad y=0,1,2,\\dots,n.\n$$ If $\\theta=0.3$ and $n=3$, then the probability of observing exactly 2 successes is $$\np(2) = \\mathrm{Pr}(Y=2 \\mid \\theta=0.3) = \\binom{3}{2\n} (0.3)^2 (0.7)^{1} = 3 \\cdot 0.09 \\cdot 0.7 = 0.189.\n$$ \n\n:::\n\n### Continuous random variables\n\nIf $\\mathcal{Y}$ is uncountable, for example, $\\mathcal{Y} = \\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathcal{Y} = (0,1)$, then $Y$ is a continuous random variable. In this case, we cannot list all possible values of $Y$ and assign probabilities to each value. Instead, we use a probability distribution to describe the distribution of $Y$. That is, the cummulative distribution function (cdf) defined as follows.\n\n\n::: {.callout-definition title = \"Cummulative distribution function\"}\n\nThe **cumulative distribution function** (cdf) of a continuous random variable $Y$ is defined as $$\nF(y) = \\mathrm{Pr}(Y \\leq y), \\quad y \\in \\mathcal{Y}.\n$$ \n\n:::\n\nNote that, for the cdf $F(y)$, we have the following properties:\n\n-   $0 \\leq F(y) \\leq 1$ for all $y\\in\\mathcal{Y}$,\n-   $F(y)$ is non-decreasing, meaning that if $y_1 < y_2$, then $F(y_1) \\leq F(y_2)$,\n-   $\\lim_{y \\to -\\infty} F(y) = 0$\n-   $\\lim_{y \\to \\infty} F(y) = 1$.\n\nProbability of various events can be derived from the cdf. For example, for any interval $A = (a,b] \\subseteq \\mathcal{Y}$, we have $$\n\\mathrm{Pr}(Y \\in A) = \\mathrm{Pr}(a < Y \\leq b) =\nF(b) - F(a).\n$$ Also, $\\mathrm{Pr}(Y \\leq a) = F(a)$ and $\\mathrm{Pr}(Y > a) = 1 - F(a)$.\n\n### Description of distributions through quantiles and moments\n\nIn this subsection, we discuss a few ways to describe probability distributions: quantiles and moments. They are used to describe the behaviour of the distribution compressing them into summary statistics.\n\n::: {.callout-definition title = \"Expectation (Mean)\"}\n\nThe **expectation** or **mean** of a random variable $Y$ can be thought as the centre of mass or the location of the distribution, which is defined as\n\n-   For discrete random variable: $$\n    E(Y) = \\sum_{y\\in\\mathcal{Y}} y p(y).\n    $$\n-   For continuous random variable: $$\n    E(Y) = \\int_{\\mathcal{Y}} y f(y) dy.\n    $$ \n    \n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note title = \"Difference between mean, mode and median\"}\n\n+ Mean: the centre of mass of the distribution \n\n+ Mode: The most probable value of $Y$ \n\n+ Median: The value of Y in the middle of the distribution. \n\n:::\n\nIn skewed distribution, the three will not equal to each other.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# -----------------------------\n# Theoretical reference lines\n# -----------------------------\nlines_normal <- data.frame(\n  value = c(0, 0, 0),\n  Statistic = c(\"Mean\", \"Median\", \"Mode\")\n)\n\nlines_lognormal <- data.frame(\n  value = c(exp(1/8), 1, exp(-1/4)),\n  Statistic = c(\"Mean\", \"Median\", \"Mode\")\n)\n\ncols <- c(\"Mean\" = \"red\", \"Median\" = \"darkgreen\", \"Mode\" = \"purple\")\n\n# -----------------------------\n# Normal distribution\n# -----------------------------\np1 <- ggplot() +\n  stat_function(fun = dnorm, size = 1, color = \"black\") +\n  geom_vline(\n    data = lines_normal,\n    aes(xintercept = value, color = Statistic),\n    linetype = \"dashed\",\n    size = 1\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = cols) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-4, 4)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Non-skewed Distribution (Normal)\",\n    x = \"Value\", y = \"Density\", color = \"Statistic\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# -----------------------------\n# Log-normal distribution: LN(0, 0.5)\n# -----------------------------\np2 <- ggplot() +\n  stat_function(\n    fun = function(x) dlnorm(x, meanlog = 0, sdlog = 0.5),\n    size = 1,\n    color = \"black\"\n  ) +\n  geom_vline(\n    data = lines_lognormal,\n    aes(xintercept = value, color = Statistic),\n    linetype = \"dashed\",\n    size = 1\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = cols) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 8)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Skewed Distribution (Log-normal)\",\n    x = \"Value\", y = \"Density\", color = \"Statistic\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\np1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](02_probability_files/figure-html/3m-comparison-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\np2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](02_probability_files/figure-html/3m-comparison-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Why use mean?\"}\n\nThe mean is widely used in statistics and data analysis for several reasons:\n\n1.  Mathematical properties: The mean has desirable mathematical properties, such as linearity, which makes it easier to work with in various statistical analyses and models.\n\n2.  Sensitivity to all values: The mean takes into account all values in the dataset, providing a comprehensive measure of central tendency. It is also a scaled version of the total, which is often an interest\n\n3.  Foundation for other statistical measures: The mean serves as the basis for many other statistical measures, such as variance and standard deviation, which are essential for understanding the spread and variability of data.\n\n4.  Mean minimizes the sum of squared deviations: The mean is the value that minimizes the sum of squared deviations (i.e., the expected penalty by choosing one value) from itself, making it a natural choice for summarizing data.\n\n5.  May contains full information: In some distributions (e.g., bernoulli distribution), the mean contains all the information about the distribution, making it a sufficient statistic for inference.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-definition title = \"Variance and Standard Deviation\"}\n\nThe **variance** of a random variable $Y$ measures the spread or dispersion of the distribution, and is defined as $$\n\\mathrm{Var}(Y) = E\\left[(Y - E(Y))^2\\right] = E[Y^2]- E^2[Y].\n$$ The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, denoted as $\\mathrm{SD}(Y) = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(Y)}$. \n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-definition title = \"Quantile\"}\n\nThe **quantile** of order $\\alpha$ of a random variable $Y$ is defined as the value $y_\\alpha$ such that $$\n\\mathrm{Pr}(Y \\leq y_\\alpha) = F(y_\\alpha) = \\alpha\n$$ for $0 < \\alpha < 1$. \n\n:::\n\nFor example, the median is the quantile of order 0.5, denoted as $y_{0.5}$, which satisfies $\\mathrm{Pr}(Y \\leq y_{0.5}) = 0.5$. Also, $(y_{0.025},y_{0.975})$ and $(y_{0.25},y_{0.75})$ contains 95% and 50% of the mass of the distribution, respectively.\n\n## Joint Disitrubiton\n\n### Discrete random variables\n\nLet $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ be two random variables with possible values in $\\mathcal{Y}_1$ and $\\mathcal{Y}_2$, respectively. The **joint distribution** of $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ describes the probability of various combinations of values that $(Y_1,Y_2)$ can take.\n\nJoint beliefs about $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ can be represented with probabilities.

For example,\n\n-   $p(y_1,y_2)=p_{Y_1 Y_2}(y_1,y_2)$ is the joint density of $Y_1$ and $Y_2$,\n-   $p(y_1)=p_{Y_1}(y_1)$ is the marginal density of $Y_1$\n-   $p(y_2 \\mid y_1)=p_{Y_2\\mid Y_1}(y_2 \\mid y_1)$ is the conditional density of $Y_2$ given $\\{Y_1=y_1\\}$, and so on.\n\n\n::: {.callout-example title = \"Joint distribution of education and income\"}\n\nSuppose a sociological study reports the following joint distribution of parents’ education level and children’s income level in a population.\n\nJoint distribution of education and income Suppose a sociological study reports the following **joint distribution** of **parents’ education level** and **children’s income level** in a population as shown in the Table below\n\n| Parent \\\\ Child         | Low Income | Middle Income | High Income |\n|-------------------------|------------|---------------|-------------|\n| **High School or Less** | 0.18       | 0.22          | 0.10        |\n| **College**             | 0.08       | 0.20          | 0.12        |\n| **Graduate School**     | 0.04       | 0.06          | 0.10        |\n\nSuppose we randomly sample a **parent–child pair** from this population.\n\nLet\\\n- $Y_1$ be the parent’s education level\\\n- $Y_2$ be the child’s income level\n\nWe are interested in the conditional probability that the child has **high income**, given that the parent has a **college education**.\n\nWe may answer this question using the conditional probability formula:\n\n$$\n\\Pr(Y_2 = \\text{High Income} \\mid Y_1 = \\text{College})\n= \\frac{\\Pr(Y_2 = \\text{High Income} \\cap Y_1 = \\text{College})}\n{\\Pr(Y_1 = \\text{College})}\n$$\n\nFrom the table,\n\n$$\n\\Pr(Y_2 = \\text{High Income} \\cap Y_1 = \\text{College}) = 0.12\n$$\n\n$$\n\\Pr(Y_1 = \\text{College}) = 0.08 + 0.20 + 0.12 = 0.40\n$$\n\nTherefore,\n\n$$\n\\Pr(Y_2 = \\text{High Income} \\mid Y_1 = \\text{College})\n= \\frac{0.12}{0.40}\n= 0.30\n$$\n\nThus, our conclusion from the table is, among children whose parents have a college education, **30%** attain high income.\n\n:::\n\n### Continuous random variables\n\nLet $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ be two continuous random variables with possible values in $\\mathcal{Y}_1$ and $\\mathcal{Y}_2$, respectively. The **joint distribution** of $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ describes the probability of various combinations of values that $(Y_1,Y_2)$ can take. We again work with the cumulative distribution function (cdf). The definition is given as follows.\n\n::: {.callout-definition title = \"Joint cumulative distribution function and joint density\"}\n\nGiven a continuous joint cdf $F_{Y_1 Y_2}(y_1,y_2)$, there is a function $p_{Y_1,Y_2}$ such that $$\nF_{Y_1,Y_2}(a,b) = \\int_{-\\infty}^a \\int_{-\\infty}^b p_{Y_1,Y_2}(y_1,y_2) dy_2 dy_1,\n$$ and $p_{Y_1,Y_2}(y_1,y_2)$ is called the *joint density function* of $Y_1$ and $Y_2$. \n\n:::\n\nSimilar to the discrete case, we can derive marginal and conditional densities from the joint density as\n\n-   Marginal density of $Y_1$: $$ \n    p_{Y_1}(y_1) = \\int_{\\mathcal{Y}_2} p_{Y_1,Y_2}(y_1,y_2) dy_2,\n    $$\n\n-   Conditional density of $Y_2$ given $\\{Y_1=y_1\\}$: $$\n    p_{Y_2 \\mid Y_1}(y_2 \\mid y_1) = \\frac{p_{Y_1,Y_2}(y_1,y_2)}{p_{Y_1}(y_1)}.\n    $$\n\nThink about why $p_{Y_2 \\mid Y_1}(y_2 \\mid y_1)$ is an actual pdf.\n\n### Mixed continuous and discrete variables\n\nIt is possible to have joint distributions involving both discrete and continuous random variables. For example, let $Y_1$ be a discrete random variable taking values in $\\mathcal{Y}_1$ and $Y_2$ be a continuous random variable taking values in $\\mathcal{Y}_2$. The joint distribution of $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ can be described by the joint density function $p_{Y_1,Y_2}(y_1,y_2)$, which gives the probability that $Y_1$ takes the value $y_1$ and $Y_2$ takes a value in an infinitesimal interval around $y_2$. One such as example is that $Y_1$ is a binary variable indicating the presence or absence of a disease, and $Y_2$ is a continuous variable representing the severity of symptoms. Suppose we define\n\n-   Marginal density $p_{Y_1}$ from our belief $\\mathrm{Pr}(Y_1=y_1)$\n-   a conditional density $p_{Y_2\\mid Y_1}$ from $\\mathrm{Pr}(Y_2\\le y_2\\mid Y_1=y_1)\\doteq F_{Y_2\\mid Y_1}(y_2\\mid y_1)$.\n\nThen, the joint density can be derived as $$\np_{Y_1,Y_2}(y_1,y_2) = p_{Y_1}(y_1) p_{Y_2 \\mid Y_1}(y_2 \\mid y_1),\n$$ and the probability can be calculated as $$\n\\mathrm{Pr}(Y_1\\in A,Y_2\\in B) = \\int_{y_2\\in B} \\left\\{\\sum_{y_1\\in A}p_{Y_1,Y_2}(y_1,y_2)\\right\\}dy_2.\n$$\n\n### Bayes' rule and parameter estimation\n\nLet\n\n-   $\\theta$: proportion of people in a large population who have a certain charactersitic.\n\n-   $Y$: number of people in a small random sample from the population who have the charactersitic\n\nThen, in this case, we may threat $\\theta$ as continuous random variable taking values in $\\Theta = (0,1)$, and $Y$ as a discrete random variable taking values in $\\mathcal{Y}= \\{0,1,2,\\dots,n\\}$, where $n$ is the sample size. *Bayesian estimation of the parameter* $\\theta$ derives from the calculate of $p(\\theta\\mid y)$ where $y$ is the observed value of $Y$. In Bayesian, this calculation first requires that we have a joint density $p(y,\\theta)$ representing our belief about $\\theta$ and the survey outcome $Y$. Often, it is natural to construct this joint density from\n\n-   $p(\\theta)$: our prior belief about $\\theta$ before seeing the data, and\n-   $p(y \\mid \\theta)$: belief about $Y$ given $\\theta$, often called the likelihood function.\n\nOnce we observed $\\{Y=y\\}$, we need to compute our updated belief about $\\theta$, represented by the **posterior density** $p(\\theta \\mid y)$ as $$\np(\\theta \\mid y) = \\frac{p(\\theta,y)}{p(y)} = \\frac{p(y \\mid \\theta) p(\\theta)}{p(y)} = \\frac{p(y \\mid \\theta) p(\\theta)}{\\int_{\\Theta} p(y \\mid \\theta) p(\\theta) d\\theta}.\n$$\n\nIf we have two values $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ in $\\Theta$ that may be true, then the ratio of their posterior densities is given by\n\n$$\n\\frac{p(\\theta_1 \\mid y)}{p(\\theta_2 \\mid y)} = \\frac{p(y \\mid \\theta_1) p(\\theta_1) / p(y)}{p(y \\mid \\theta_2) p(\\theta_2) / p(y)} =\n\\frac{p(y \\mid \\theta_1) p(\\theta_1)}{p(y \\mid \\theta_2) p(\\theta_2)}.\n$$\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Note\"}\n\nFrom this calculation, we notice when we are calculating the relative posterior probability between two parameter values **we do not need** calculate $p(y)$ out.\n\n:::\n\nAnother way to think about this is, for a function of $\\theta$, $$\np(\\theta \\mid y) \\propto p(y \\mid \\theta) p(\\theta).\n$$\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Note\"}\n\nWe will see that the numerator is the important part, while the denominator is just a normalizing constant to make sure the posterior density integrates to 1.\n\n:::\n\n## Independence Random Variables\n\nLet $Y_1,\\dots,Y_n$ be random variables with joint density $p(y_1,\\dots,y_n)$, and $\\theta$ is the parameter describe the conditions under which the random variables are generated. We say that $Y_1,\\dots,Y_n$ are conditionally independent given $\\theta$ if every collection of $n$ sets $\\{A_1,\\dots,A_n\\}$ satisfies $$\n\\mathrm{Pr}(Y_1 \\in A_1,\\dots,Y_n \\in A_n \\mid \\theta) = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\mathrm{Pr}(Y_i \\in A_i \\mid \\theta).\n$$ If we have independence property, then $$\n\\mathrm{Pr}(Y_i\\in A_i \\mid \\theta, Y_j\\in A_j) = \\mathrm{Pr}(Y_i \\in A_i \\mid \\theta),\n$$ so the conditional indpenddence can be interpreted as meaning that $Y_j$ gives no additional information about $Y_i$ once we know $\\theta$. Also, under independence, the joint density can be factorized as $$\np(y_1,\\dots,y_n \\mid \\theta) = \\prod_{i= 1}^n p_{Y_i}(y_i \\mid \\theta).\n$$\n\nIf the samples are also identically distributed, meaning that each $Y_i$ has the same marginal density $p_Y(y \\mid \\theta)$, then the joint density can be further simplified as $$\np(y_1,\\dots,y_n \\mid \\theta) = \\prod_{i= 1}^n p_Y(y_i \\mid \\theta).\n$$\n\nIn this case , we say that $Y_1,\\dots,Y_n$ are **independent and identically distributed** (i.i.d.) given $\\theta$, with notation $$  \nY_1,\\dots,Y_n\\mid \\theta \\stackrel{i.i.d.}{\\sim} p_Y(y \\mid \\theta).\n$$\n\n## Exchangeability\n\n::: {.callout-definition title = \"Exchangeability\"}\n\nA sequence of random variables $Y_1,Y_2,\\dots,Y_n$ is **exchangeable** if for any permutation $\\pi$ of the indices $\\{1,2,\\dots ,n\\}$, we have $$\np(y_1,y_2,\\dots,y_n) = p(y_{\\pi(1 )},y_{\\pi(2)},\\dots,y_{\\pi(n)}).\n$$ \n\n:::\n\nIn other words, the joint density of an exchangeable sequence is invariant to the order of the random variables.
